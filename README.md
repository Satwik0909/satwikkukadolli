## 🧠 About Me

I’m a software developer with hands-on experience building and maintaining production-grade web and SaaS systems.  
My primary focus is backend engineering — designing APIs, data models, and system flows that scale cleanly and remain easy to reason about over time.

I care less about trendy stacks and more about **engineering decisions that age well in production**.

Currently, I work with **Django, Django REST Framework, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL**, contributing to systems used by real users at a national scale.
